What is **MongoDB**? **MongoDB** is a NOSQL database that uses JSON like documents with optional schemas. To start testing and learning **MongoDB** I initially started by using Mongo Atlas (a cloud service set up by the **MongoDB** developers) with my end goal being to solve a few questions on Stack Overflow to further develop my own skills.

I Chose **MongoDB** due to my interests in databases and techniques used to create and query them monthey are to traditional SQL databases. To start with I watched a youtube video that gave a brief crash course on **MongoDB** (Featured in the Learners Guide) and learned skills such as creating collections and documents, querying and compound querying.

I mainly struggled upon choosing a topic with it taking many many weeks of decisions and changes but eventually I settled on this. The one key thing I am concerned about is if starting point counts as collaboration if I use stack overflow questions as a learning basis and then continue to use it to answer questions themselves later on. 
As my initial start I chose a simple query question to work on and develop my skills, as seen in the image next to me. I will aim to answer this by the next learning log and continually update my development as I progress.
