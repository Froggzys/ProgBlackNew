Entry 1

What is **MongoDB**? **MongoDB** is a NOSQL database that uses JSON like documents with optional schemas. To start testing and learning **MongoDB** I initially started by using Mongo Atlas (a cloud service set up by the **MongoDB** developers) with my end goal being to solve a few questions on Stack Overflow to further develop my own skills.

I Chose **MongoDB** due to my interests in databases and techniques used to create and query them monthey are to traditional SQL databases. To start with I watched a youtube video that gave a brief crash course on **MongoDB** (Featured in the Learners Guide) and learned skills such as creating collections and documents, querying and compound querying.

I mainly struggled upon choosing a topic with it taking many many weeks of decisions and changes but eventually I settled on this. The one key thing I am concerned about is if starting point counts as collaboration if I use stack overflow questions as a learning basis and then continue to use it to answer questions themselves later on. 
As my initial start I chose a simple query question to work on and develop my skills, as seen in the image next to me. I will aim to answer this by the next learning log and continually update my development as I progress.

Entry 2

In regards to last weeks question I realised its more difficult than originally intended as I have to search by the number of dishes in each restaurant and then match the name of each dish to the full items. Learning how to do this is taking more time than I thought it would be so I think I’m going to make it a final goal and attempt some potentially easier questions on **MongoDB** to start with.
I realise that to start with I didn’t consider the question in its entirety and “bit off more than I can chew”. Another key thing I noticed was when I make my **MongoDB** queries I imagine them as SQL queries and try and convert to NOSQL after. I realise that I need to get out of the habit of converting SQL to NOSQL instead of just immediately writing queries but it’s not something I can immediately do at my level of knowledge of **MongoDB**. In order to at least further my understanding of this, I used my practice questions on SQL databases from Computer Systems and wrote some of the example queries in NOSQL. I found this to be an effective way of learning **MongoDB** and It proved helpful. 
I then Found a website with a variety of questions on **MongoDB** queries https://www.w3resource.com/mongodb-exercises/ and started to work my way through those however on the later ones I found myself struggling, specifically with ones such as

For those ones I ended up having to work through the editor and trying to reverse engineer my understanding of the subject as it was stuff that I was less experienced with in SQL. I would also like to learn how to use and setup **MongoDB** compass on a local system for the sake of making collaborative projects with my peers rather than using the online atlas software. I’m also going to use the **MongoDB** compass to learn how to quickly aggregate data and use the tools correctly compare to just making queries. This is going to be a secondary goal for the next entry.
