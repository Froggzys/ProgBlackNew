A Beginners guide to MongoDB. 

What is MongoDB?

*MongoDB* is an open-source cross platform database program. In which information Is stored in JSON-like ‘Documents’ instead of table columns/rows. *MongoDB* is classified as A **NoSQL** database management program. They offer cloud services hosted on *Amazon Web Services*, *Google Cloud Platform* and *Microsoft Azure* with free clusters or for larger businesses they offer monthly subscription-based tiers.

Why Should I Learn MongoDB?

*MongoDB* Is used by many companies around the world including *eBay*, *Forbes* and *Sanoma*. It **scales Horizontally** – Adding more machines to the current system infrastructure whereas traditional **SQL** databases **scale Vertically** by adding power to current machines. *Sanoma* was quickly able to scale its servers to tenfold increase the capacity of its learning app *Bingel*. ** NOSQL**  database software like *MongoDB* is becoming more desired in the real world. 
*MongoDB* ‘s **searching algorithms** are faster than **SQL** Databases as well. As data is saved in **documents**. Due to it being Schema-less the data is easier to find and also easier to code too.
According to an article from *AcadGild*, “MongoDB responsible for more than 50% of all mentions of NoSQL database in LinkedIn member profiles in 2015 Q3, placing it way ahead of its competitor.” It is the most prevalent **NoSQL** Database system meaning it has a larger userbase than its competitors.
Some other competitors to *MongoDB* in the **NoSQL** Field is *Cassandra*, *ElasticSearch* and *HBase*. 

What do I need to know before starting?

Personally, I found knowing **SQL** and how databases work in **SQL** as a big help to me when starting my *MongoDB* path. It is not requirement to know this though, and you can learn how databases work without that knowledge. A Knowledge of **JavaScript** and **Node** certainly helps when trying to integrate and practically use *MongoDB* with other software.
**JavaScript** is easy to learn if you know other programming languages, the video below quite useful in order to learn how it fundamentally works. **JavaScript** is also a very good language to learn as it is one of the most common programming languages.

In terms of learning **Node**, the video below is how I learnt my understanding of it. **Node** is a bit more difficult to learn and understand but definitely a skill that’s needed for a lot of computing jobs.

I have also attached documentation for **JS** and **Node**.

Understanding **SQL** databases helped me understand some of the terminology and ways in which databases work but is not fundamental due to *MongoDB* not using **SQL**. I also found it easier to query due to my previous knowledge in **SQL**.

The website above proved vital in my understanding of **SQL**. 

How Difficult is MongoDB?

There are two aspects to this question, the use of the *MongoDB* software and the language for querying and setting up MongoDB. The query language uses the same language as documents which is a bonus but overall I’d say not too difficult and definitely worth it to learn if you have the time
Their software *MongoDB Compass* takes some time to get your head around, but it is worth it due to the complete functionality and flexibility of the software.
