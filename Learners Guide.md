What is MongoDB?

*MongoDB* is an open-source cross platform database program. In which information Is stored in JSON-like ‘Documents’ instead of table columns/rows. *MongoDB* is classified as A **NoSQL** database management program. They offer cloud services hosted on *Amazon Web Services*, *Google Cloud Platform* and *Microsoft Azure* with free clusters or for larger businesses they offer monthly subscription-based tiers.

Why Should I Learn MongoDB?

*MongoDB* Is used by many companies around the world including *eBay*, *Forbes* and *Sanoma*. It **scales Horizontally** – Adding more machines to the current system infrastructure whereas traditional **SQL** databases **scale Vertically** by adding power to current machines. *Sanoma* was quickly able to scale its servers to tenfold increase the capacity of its learning app *Bingel*. ** NOSQL** database software like *MongoDB* is becoming more desired in the real world.

*MongoDB* ‘s **searching algorithms** are faster than **SQL** Databases as well. As data is saved in **documents**. Due to it being Schema-less the data is easier to find and also easier to code too.

According to an article from *AcadGild*, “MongoDB responsible for more than 50% of all mentions of NoSQL database in LinkedIn member profiles in 2015 Q3, placing it way ahead of its competitor.” It is the most prevalent **NoSQL** Database system meaning it has a larger userbase than its competitors.

Some other competitors to *MongoDB* in the **NoSQL** Field is *Cassandra*, *ElasticSearch* and *HBase*.

What do I need to know before starting?

Personally, I found knowing **SQL** and how databases work in **SQL** as a big help to me when starting my *MongoDB* path. It is not requirement to know this though, and you can learn how databases work without that knowledge. A Knowledge of **JavaScript** and **Node** certainly helps when trying to integrate and practically use *MongoDB* with other software.

**JavaScript** is easy to learn if you know other programming languages, the video below quite useful in order to learn how it fundamentally works. **JavaScript** is also a very good language to learn as it is one of the most common programming languages.

In terms of learning **Node**, the video below is how I learnt my understanding of it. **Node** is a bit more difficult to learn and understand but definitely a skill that’s needed for a lot of computing jobs.

I have also attached documentation for **JS** and **Node**.

Understanding **SQL** databases helped me understand some of the terminology and ways in which databases work but is not fundamental due to *MongoDB* not using **SQL**. I also found it easier to query due to my previous knowledge in **SQL**.

The website above proved vital in my understanding of **SQL**.

How Difficult is MongoDB?

There are two aspects to this question, the use of the *MongoDB* software and the language for querying and setting up MongoDB. The query language uses the same language as documents which is a bonus but overall I’d say not too difficult and definitely worth it to learn if you have the time

Their software *MongoDB Compass* takes some time to get your head around, but it is worth it due to the complete functionality and flexibility of the software.


Key MongoDB Terminology

This document provides a list of key *MongoDB* terminology to start with before you learn. Some of it will take a while to get your head around without **SQL** knowledge but ultimately is not too difficult.

The main things I would recommend learning and understanding are the things at the top of this page as they are the most important things for a beginner developer.

How do I learn MongoDB?
Before you begin you need to install *MongoDB Shell* and I would recommend using **MongoDB Atlas** to start with as it provides an amazing free tier for experimenting with the software. https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

To start with I watched this video which proved helpful in teaching me the language, it is excellently formatted and provides helpful information for beginners although at times you may have to pause the video. There are other videos on YouTube providing Similar information and advice to beginners.

I would then recommend doing practice questions online as well as making your own queries to hone your skills. Next up I would recommend learning *MongoDB Compass* which will help you to understand the Language at a fundamental level.

Next thing I recommend learning is how to integrate *MongoDB* into **Node**.

[https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mongodb.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mongodb.asp)

This website is especially useful and provides tips for setting up the database and querying in *MongoDB*. Other resources include other websites and videos on **YouTube**.
